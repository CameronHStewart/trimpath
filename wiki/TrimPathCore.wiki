#Query and JST modules for use in many contexts

= Introduction =

Enterprise tested Query and JST modules.  Plus some extra utilities.  

A few people have done memory allocation experiments in browsers finding that there is at least 20 meg at your disposal for javascript.  That's a lot of room to play with regular Trimpath Query before you would need a storage solution (gears).   

= Details =

TrimPath Core was started from issue 31:

You can find dev and minified uploads there.

Notes:
possible avenues for improvement (templating costs most to do)
- incorporate code from higher performing JST implementation that was circulating in forums
- div pools to reuse somehow for templating
- try some stress tests,  possible to free up allocated divs when replacing div,  or is it automatic,  or would it be a leak if you do a lot of DOM templating?
