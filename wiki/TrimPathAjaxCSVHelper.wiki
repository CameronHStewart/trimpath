#summary Server-side helper to echo back dataset in CSV (and various) formats

= Introduction =

data:uri is not fully supported in browsers.  Were it supported the same code would work on IE as it does on Firefox,  and you could have full control over the filename (if it is a CSV export you are doing).

Therefore,  small server-side echo functions are required to help your AJAX page to do CSV export download files (not to mention PDF or Word or other formats for whatever data the user filters on the ajax page).

The purpose is to do all the real work on the browser,  and only echo the dataset in various formats from the server (do not duplicate so much data query facilities on the server,  duplicating what is done with Trimpath Query,  for example).
