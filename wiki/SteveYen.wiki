I'm a founder of TrimPath and [http://www.metaha.com Metaha].  Further back, I also was a co-founder of [http://www.escalate.com Escalate] and KIVA Software.

I've been playing lately with Brendan and Waldemar's little language, !JavaScript, trying to see for myself if all this rich web application hoo-dad (Ajax) is really going to fly.  First, after un-learning everything I thought I knew about the !JavaScript, I think I'm starting to understand.

Also, I've started exploring [http://rubyonrails.com Ruby on Rails].

I hear I must keep my New Year's resolutions secret if they are to come true.
